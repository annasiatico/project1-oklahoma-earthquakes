# Oklahoma Earthquakes

## Background

Oklahoma now has more earthquakes on a regular basis than California. Are they due to fracking?
In a few cases, yes, but in most cases no. Only a few of the over 2000 magnitude 3 and larger earthquakes since 2009 that have occurred in Oklahoma have been connected to hydraulic fracturing. 

The majority of earthquakes in Oklahoma are caused by the industrial practice​ known as "wastewater disposal". Wastewater disposal is a ​separate ​process in which fluid waste from oil and gas production is injected deep underground far below ground water or drinking water aquifers. In Oklahoma over 90% of the wastewater that is injected is a byproduct of oil extraction process and not waste frack fluid.

The purpose of this project is to prove that waste water disposal is the contributing factor to the earthquakes.

## Scope of Work
* Date range is from 2013 - 2018
* Earthquake recording of magnitude 2.5 or higher only

## Plots
* This plot show the number of wells and seismic activity per conuty

## Observations

*  There is a positive correlation between water waste disposal and seismic events on a statewide level

*  The correlation observed on a state level begins to break down on a county level

		1. The breakdown in the state wide correlation at the county level suggests there are other controlling parameters such as underlying geologic complexity, total volume per well, or the amount injected in a given period of time

		2. Since the Total Volume was observed to control the upward trending seismic event count the well number doesn't appear to be a controlling factor, but rather the total amount in a given well

		3. The 'total event per city' plot corroborates the 'events per county' plot and compel our group to suggest investigation of other industry trends to see if there are observed effects, i.e. real estate market trends in high event areas to determine effect of seismicity on other valuation

*	Likely there is a relationship between depth of injectino and seismic event frequency since certain formations are more frequently linked to deep basement faults. These fault systems are likely the ones that are critically stressed and result in the largest event magnitudes
      
*  Suggestions for future work include:

		1.  overlaying USGS fault coordinates on map to establish proximity relationship to injectors

		2.  investigating aforementioned effects on outside industry

		3.  pump rates in seismically active areas
